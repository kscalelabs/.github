<hr />

K-Scale Labs is a machine learning startup building software for the next generation of embodied artificial intelligence.

Located near Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley, we are a team of engineers and researchers with the mission to build a future where billions of humanoid robots assist humans with everything from household chores to industrial labor.

Our first development, Stompy, is an open-source bipedal humanoid robot that can be easily manufactured by individuals using 3D printing. Stompy is a template low-cost humanoid robot that can be customized or used as a reference design.

If you are interested in building or developing your own humanoid robot, please get in touch.
